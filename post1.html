        Welcome to <strong>Rahman Space</strong>When I look back at where I started, I smile at how far I’ve come. I didn’t grow up with everything laid out for me, and I wasn’t born a “tech genius.” I was just curious. That curiosity was the spark that pushed me into this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I didn’t even know what “HTML” or “CSS” meant. All I knew was that I wanted to create something on the internet — something that carried my name. I remember the excitement the first time I typed a few lines of code and saw them come alive on a browser. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like magic. That magic was enough to keep me going.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent hours searching, asking questions, and sometimes feeling completely lost. There were days when nothing worked, and I wanted to give up. But one thing kept me pushing forward — the belief that every expert was once a beginner, and every mistake was a step toward progress. 
      </p>
      <p>Slowly, I started to understand the structure of a webpage, how tags worked, how CSS added life to plain text. I still remember the struggle of getting my first image to show up correctly — such a small thing, but for me, it was a victory. Each small win built my confidence.</p>
      <p>
        This blog, Rahman Space, is more than just a website. It’s proof of my journey — from being confused and asking simple questions, to now building something I can proudly call my own. It’s the beginning of a bigger dream: to learn, to grow, and to share everything I discover along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
If you’re reading this and you’ve ever felt lost in tech, know that you’re not alone. I started just like you. And if I can do it, so can you.
      </p>

Welcome to my space. This is only the beginning.
