<h2>1️⃣ Don’t Try to Learn Everything at Once</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Rahman Space</strong>When I first started, I thought I needed to learn Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and more… all at the same time. Big mistake. Focus on one skill/language first, and build from there.
      </p>
      <h3>2️⃣ Consistency Beats Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        I used to wait until I “felt motivated.” But motivation comes and goes consistency is what makes you grow in tech. Even 30 minutes a day adds up faster than you think.
      </p>
      <h>3️⃣ Projects Teach You More Than Tutorials</h>
      <p>
       Watching endless tutorials gave me knowledge, but building my own small projects gave me real skills. Start small even a simple portfolio site can change your mindset.
      </p>
      <h5>4️⃣ Google & Community Are Your Friends</h5>
      <p>I thought real developers just “knew it all.” But truth is, even the best devs Google daily. Forums, communities, and asking questions are part of the process not a weakness.</p>
      <h6>5️⃣ It’s a Journey, Not a Race</h6>
      <p>
       At first, I kept comparing myself to others who seemed way ahead. But tech isn’t about speed it’s about persistence. Everyone’s journey is different, and that’s okay.
